  #   # This test will fail and we won't accept that! For Homebrew/homebrew-core
  #   # this will need to be a test that verifies the functionality of the
  #   # software. Run the test with `brew test simplestack`. Options passed
  #   # to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`.

  #   # The installed folder is not in the path, so use the entire path to any
  #   # executables being tested: `system "#{bin}/program", "do", "something"`.
